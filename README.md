# Pose Estimation Applications

Applying 3D pose estimation algorithms with 3D redering softwares such as Blender and Unity for computer animations. 

## Current Status

Used OpenPose and a stereo camera setup to generate 3D pose estimation data, and fed it into a Blender script to generate real-time synchroniztion with a live video feed and an arbitrary 3D model.
